We are a couple of wannabe potters living in San Diego, CA. We created this site to document our journey, and to hopefully help others learn along the way.

Our backgrounds are in Coffee, Web Development, and Nursing, but we've always been creative people. Pottery has been calling our names for a while, and we finally decided to take the jump.
