We are the Spindlers. We started dating when we were 16 (about the time of the picture above), got married when we were 20 and 21, and now that we are in our 30s with two kids, we are still having just as much fun as ever. We currently live in San Diego, CA, though we've lived in Missouri, Kentucky, and even taught English together in China for a bit.

For a number of years, we've wanted to dive into the world of pottery, drawn particularly to hand-thrown coffee mugs and planters. Our backgrounds are in specialty coffee, web development, and nursing, but we've always been creatives. Whether its pottery, woodworking, latte art, or interior design, we seek to learn as much as we can but also to have a good time.

We are currently practicing on a [Speedball Artista Pottery Wheel](https://www.theceramicshop.com/product/576/artista-pottery-wheel-ci/?gclid=CjwKCAjw5Kv7BRBSEiwAXGDElTw2wL8y1tYRTiItwHszHZXFD1AFtxzkBxeFJ3XTpK9gNQFPUlSDRxoC3dwQAvD_BwE), using Mudtools ribs and sponges. We do not have our own kiln yet, but hopefully we can have one in the future. At this moment, we are not selling any of our pots, but we hope to open up an online shop in the future as well.

If you have any questions or just want to chat, [hit us up](/contact)! We'd love to connect!

Thanks for stopping by!
